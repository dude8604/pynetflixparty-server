# Netflix Party for Python

This is a Python port of the server for Stephan Boyers' Netflix Party Chrome extension.  I am only porting the server part - the other parts make more sense as a Chrome extension.  You will have to modify the Chrome extension part so it points to your server if you want to use this.

Requires:
* pynetflixparty-server (can install with pip)
* eventlet

----------------------

Netflix Party is a Chrome extension for watching Netflix remotely with friends, e.g., for movie nights with that long-distance special someone. It synchronizes video playback and adds group chat.

This is the server. The source for the Chrome extension can be found [here](https://github.com/boyers/netflixparty-chrome), and the source for the [website](https://www.netflixparty.com) can be found [here](https://github.com/boyers/netflixparty-website). The Chrome extension is published [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/netflix-party/oocalimimngaihdkbihfgmpkcpnmlaoa) in the Chrome Web Store.
